# profile-report
A series of jupyter notebooks to generate an analytics report.
Run notebooks in order after adding necessary csv exports from database sql in ./queries to data folder.
You will probably need to analyze the clusters in the first notebook and reorder and possibly rename the clusters, as the k-mean clustering algorithm might not keep stable as data changes.
