A score of 1 in the \"Collective admin\" metric means that particular user tops the chart in collective admin activities platform-wide. Notably, these scores are logarithmic, ranging from 0 to 1. This scale enables us to equitably compare highly active users with their less active counterparts. For instance, a collective admin who approves 19 expenses annually might have a score of 0.47, while one that approves 190 expenses could score 0.85. Without such a scoring system, graphs would be less insightful due to the vast activity gap between the most active and the occasional users.</p>\n",
