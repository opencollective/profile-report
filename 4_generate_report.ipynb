This scale enables us to equitably compare highly active users with their less active counterparts. For instance, a collective admin who approves 19 expenses annually might have a score of 0.47, while one that approves 190 expenses could score 0.85. Without such a scoring system, graphs would be less insightful due to the vast activity gap between the most active and the occasional users.</p>\n",

    "                <li>Rows in both expenses and income datasets having a specific pattern in their slug (ending with <string>-<number>.<number>) were removed. This is because this pattern was identified as belonging to spammers.</li>\n",
